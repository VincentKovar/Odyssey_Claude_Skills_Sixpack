name: hook-research-analyzer
description: >
  Analyzes any research input â€” TikTok scrapes, customer reviews, Reddit threads, Motion reports,
  or raw notes â€” and outputs a structured hook research brief ready for caption and hook writing.
  Use this skill whenever Jake or the team wants to: analyze organic content, extract motivators
  from reviews, run research before a hook writing session, understand what language a persona
  actually uses, or build the strategic foundation before writing any hooks.
  Trigger on: "analyze this scrape", "what are the motivators here", "run research for [brand/persona]",
  "what's the language this persona uses", "analyze these reviews for hook insights",
  "pull insights from this", or any time raw research needs to be turned into hook-ready strategy.
  Always run this skill BEFORE the caption-hook-writer skill â€” never write hooks without research.

# Hook Research Analyzer

This skill takes raw research inputs and transforms them into a structured Hook Research Brief â€” the strategic foundation every hook writing session needs before a single word gets written.

**Core belief:** Hooks that stop people aren't written â€” they're discovered. The language, the numbers, the emotional triggers are already out there in reviews, organic content, and community conversations. This skill finds them.

## Step 0 â€” Check Project Files First

Before analyzing any research input, always check the project files for this brand. Project files contain existing brand context, persona maps, past creative strategy, and any prior research briefs that should inform the analysis.

**Do this before anything else:**
1. Review all available project files for the brand
2. Note any existing persona definitions, motivators, or benefit angles already documented
3. Note any formats, angles, or approaches that have already been tested or are currently in use
4. Use this context to make the Hook Research Brief additive â€” build on what's already known, don't repeat it

If project files contain a prior Hook Research Brief for this persona, flag it and confirm with the user whether to update the existing brief or create a new one for a different input source.

## Inputs This Skill Accepts

| Input Type | What to Look For |
|---|---|
| TikTok / organic content scrape | Visual hook patterns, recurring pain language, comment sentiment, virality signals |
| Customer reviews (CSV or text) | Exact phrases customers use, trigger events, before/after language, objections |
| Reddit / community threads | Raw unfiltered frustration, questions people ask before buying, competitor complaints |
| Motion performance report | Which angles are winning in paid, format patterns, hook types converting |
| Raw notes / brainstorm | Any unstructured research â€” extract and organize |

Multiple inputs can be analyzed together. When combining sources, note which insights came from which source â€” paid signal vs. organic signal are different.

## Output Format â€” The Hook Research Brief

Always structure output in this exact format. Every section is required.

---

### BRAND / PERSONA
`[Brand name] â€” [Persona name]`

---

### TOP PAIN POINTS
The 3â€“5 most recurring painful situations this persona is in. Written in their language, not marketing language. Each pain point should be specific enough to become a hook.

Format:
- **[Pain point label]:** "[Exact or near-exact language from the research]"

---

### MOTIVATORS
The emotional truths driving this persona's decision. Not what they want to buy â€” what they feel that makes them open to buying. Rank by strength.

Format:
1. **[Motivator]** â€” [One sentence on why this is the strongest emotional driver]
2. **[Motivator]** â€” [One sentence]
3. **[Motivator]** â€” [One sentence]

---

### DESIRED OUTCOMES
What they actually want on the other side. Not the product's features â€” the life they're trying to get to. These become benefit angles.

Format:
- [Outcome in their language]

---

### HOOK-READY LANGUAGE
Exact words, phrases, and numbers pulled directly from the research that should appear in hooks. This is the specificity that makes hooks feel real.

Format:
- **Numbers/stats:** [Any specific numbers, dollar amounts, timeframes that appeared]
- **Exact phrases:** [Verbatim language from reviews, comments, transcripts]
- **Emotional words:** [High-charge words this persona uses]

---

### VISUAL HOOK SIGNALS
Patterns from organic content showing what's visually stopping people in this category. Cross-reference with visual hook categories in the hook database.

Format:
- [Visual pattern observed] â†’ maps to **[Visual Hook Category]**

---

### CAPTION HOOK SIGNALS
Caption patterns and structures appearing in high-performing organic content. Cross-reference with the 16 caption hook categories in the hook database.

Format:
- [Caption pattern observed] â†’ maps to **[Caption Hook Category]**

---

### AWARENESS LEVEL SIGNALS
Where does this research suggest the majority of this audience sits on the awareness spectrum? What evidence supports that read?

Format:
- **Primary level:** [TOF / MOF / BOF] â€” [Evidence from research]
- **Secondary level:** [TOF / MOF / BOF] â€” [Evidence from research]

---

### TOP 3 ANGLES TO TEST
Based on everything above, the three strongest hook angles to write first. Each angle combines a persona situation + motivator + benefit into one sentence.

Format:
1. **[Angle name]:** [One sentence â€” who it's for, what emotional truth it taps, what outcome it points to]
2. **[Angle name]:** [One sentence]
3. **[Angle name]:** [One sentence]

---

### WHAT TO AVOID
Angles, language, or framings the research suggests won't land â€” because they're overused, off-tone, or miss the real trigger.

Format:
- [What to avoid and why]

---

## How to Use This Output

Once the Hook Research Brief is complete:
1. Pick one motivator from the brief to anchor the session
2. Pick one desired outcome as the benefit angle
3. Take hook-ready language into the caption-hook-writer skill
4. Reference the top 3 angles as the starting point for hook generation

See `references/research-examples.md` for worked examples of briefs across different input types.
